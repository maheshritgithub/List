# List

This is the README for the "List" project. Below you'll find information about the project, how to get started, and more.

## Getting Started

This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It's a React-based project that provides various scripts for development, testing, building, and more.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload when you make changes.

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. You can find more information about running tests [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production, optimizing the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include unique hashes, making your app ready for deployment. You can find more details about deployment [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

- `npm run eject`: Please note that this is a one-way operation. Once you "eject," you can't go back. It removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project. This allows you to have full control over these dependencies. The other commands except "eject" will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. You don't have to use "eject," as the curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments. You can customize it when you're ready.
